## About The Project
Instagram Webber is a Python script that scrapes Instagram's website with a headless browser and extracts the following information: username, photo url, description, likes/dislikes, comments, tags and followers. It then proceeds to find the friends, cliques and basic friendships group with set operations. It then displays this information in an easy to read format on your screen along with automated csv file creation. You can also use it as a simple web scraper by adding some basic code to scrape other sites such as Facebook or Twitter.

# A Few Notes 
* Only essential src files are included. 
* The code is not commented since it was for personal use and the function names are intended to be clear.
* Certain files and directories were removed to prevent abuse. 
* Best used as a function library in python interactive.
